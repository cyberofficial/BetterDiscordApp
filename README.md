# BandagedBD with out the Racist BLM Link

BandagedBD (Bandaged BetterDiscord) is a fork of the original [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp) by Jiiks. This has a number of improvements over the original. The original version has been unmaintained hence this fork existing. There have been attempts to rewrite the original that I have been and will continue to be involved in, but in the meantime I will continue to maintain and improve BBD.

# FAQ

### What is this?
This is a client modification for Discord. It allows you to add plugins and themes to your client. Plugins can add functionality and useful features. Themes can completely change the look and feel of Discord.

BBD has some other built-in features such as Emotes from Twitch, FFZ, and BBTV, as well as an in-client server browser.

### Where can I get plugins and themes?
In our support servers we have channels with lists of official plugins and themes. Please note we do not have an official listing on a website and are **not affiliated with any of those websites**.

### Support Servers?
There are two: [The main server](https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORCRqbAd), and [the backup](https://discord.gg/2HScm8j).
